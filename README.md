# Artatawe auctioning system (Updated)
This system works in the same way as ebay but with a twist. The auctions have a set amount of bids, when those run out the last bid is the winner of that auction.

This version was personally updated with:
- Passwords (Using BCrypt)
- Sorting function

This project was created for the module **CS-235** at Swansea University. This is a group project which I was a part of.

# Usage
- Run `Artatawe_v2.jar` **OR** run `source/controllers/Main.java`
